Thanks for downloading my 3d work!

The bag was intended for a halloween animation.
Hopefully you can find a use for it too!

The bag is UVW mapped and the texture is provided
in photoshop format for ease of modification.

Have fun with your new object! If you do something
with it please let me know?
